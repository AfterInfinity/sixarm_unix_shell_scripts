# Uninstall RVM (Ruby Version Manager). THIS IS DANGEROUS.
#
# This runs rvm implode, delete RVM files from the system,
# deletes /home/*/.rvmrc files and /home/*/.rvm directories,
# and uninstalls all RVM gems. We run this script as root.
#
# If rvm implode gives errors like this loop:
#
#    line 72: /usr/local/rvm/scripts/rvm: No such file or directory
#
# then the rvm setup is bonked and we can delete the rvm script
# by hand then run this script again; rvm implode won't work,
# but the rest of the script will do a decent job of deleting
# any lingering rvm files and reporting any remainders.
