# Generate a random password then encrypt it.

# Syntax:
#
#   random-password-encrypt <filepath>
#
# Output:
#
#   <filepath>.gpg file with encrypted password.
#
# This uses two SixArm scripts:
#
#   * random-password to generate the password.
#   * gpg-encrypt to encrypt the password file.
#
# You need both of these for this script to work.
