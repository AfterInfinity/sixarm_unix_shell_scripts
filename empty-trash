##
# Empty the trash on an Ubuntu system.
#
# This deletes all the files in a user's typical trash directory:
#
#    ~/.local/share/Trash/files
#
# Example:
#
#    empty-trash
#
# Any args are passed along to the rm command.
#
# Example:
#
#    empty-trash --verbose
#
##

# Remove files one-by-one, without double-quoted files, 
# because the file list may be very long, and the quote may not work.
find ~/.local/share/Trash/{files,info}/ -type f | grep -v '"' | xargs -I{} rm -rf "$@" "{}"

# Remove remainders
rm -rf "$@" ~/.local/share/Trash/{files,info}/*
