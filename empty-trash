# Empty the trash on an Ubuntu system.
#
# This deletes all the files in a user's typical trash directory:
#
#    ~/.local/share/Trash/files
#
# Example:
#
#    empty-trash
#
# Any args are passed along to the rm command.
#
# Example:
#
#    empty-trash --verbose
#
##

# We do not use -delete because we want to pass args to rm.
# We do not use -exec rm because it glitches on unusual characters.
# We use grep to filter out quoted file names because rm glitches on these.
find ~/.local/share/Trash/files/ ~/.local/share/Trash/info/ -type f | grep -v '"' | grep -v "'" | xargs -I{} rm -rf "$@" "{}"

# Remove any remainders by using a wildcard.
rm -rf "$@" ~/.local/share/Trash/{files,info}/*
